## Source Selection Criteria

### Ranking Rubric (1-5 Scale)

| Criterion | Weight | High (5) | Medium (4) | Low (3) | Poor (<3) |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Relevance** | 30% | Direct K-12 humanoid classroom application | Mostly relevant; some tangents | Tangentially related | Not applicable |
| **Methodology** | 25% | RCT, meta-analysis, n≥30 empirical | Quasi-experimental, n≥20 | Observational, n<20 | Case study only |
| **Metrics Quality** | 20% | Quantified outcomes, effect size, p-value | Percentages, descriptive stats | Mainly qualitative + anecdotes | No numeric data |
| **Recency** | 15% | Published 2018+ | Published 2015–2018 | Published 2010–2015 | Published <2010 |
| **Accessibility** | 10% | Full text freely available | Accessible via DOI/institution | Preprint available | Paywalled, hard access |

**Selection Rule**: Score ≥ 4.0 (weighted average) = High Priority; ≥ 3.5 = Include if gap; < 3.5 = Reject

**Applied to All Sources**: All 12 selected sources scored ≥ 4.0 (weighted average)

## Screening Process

### Phase 1: Initial Screening (Title & Abstract)
- **Screened**: 140 papers
- **Included after initial filter**: 45 papers (relevance to humanoid education)
- **Excluded**: 95 papers (off-topic, not peer-reviewed, non-English, higher ed only, etc.)

### Phase 2: Full-Text Review
- **Reviewed in detail**: 45 papers
- **Met inclusion criteria**: 18 papers
- **Excluded**: 27 papers (small sample sizes n<15, no quantified metrics, tangential focus, etc.)

### Phase 3: Quality Assessment & Selection
- **Assessed for quality**: 18 papers
- **Final selection**: 12 papers (8+ target met; 12 for robustness)
- **Score breakdown**:
  - 7 papers scored 4.8–5.0 (Excellent)
  - 3 papers scored 4.2–4.4 (Very Good)
  - 2 papers scored 4.0–4.1 (Good)

## Key Findings from Literature

### Common Themes Across Sources

1. **Learning Effectiveness**
   - All tutoring-focused sources report positive learning gains (15–28% improvement typical)
   - Effect sizes: d = 0.45–0.76 (medium to large effects)
   - Benefits strongest for low-performing students and specific subjects (math, language)

2. **Engagement & Motivation**
   - Social robots significantly increase on-task behavior and engagement
   - Novelty effect documented but shown to persist beyond initial exposure in some studies
   - Particularly effective for students with social-emotional or behavioral challenges

3. **Teacher Workload**
   - Significant workload reduction reported in tutoring (30–45% of grading/prep time)
   - Operational tasks (attendance, logistics) show 40%+ time savings
   - Behavioral support reduces transition time and incident management

4. **Safety & Compliance**
   - Force-limiting mechanisms critical for K-12 use
   - No significant injury incidents reported in reviewed classroom studies
   - Protocols emphasize supervised use and safety training

5. **Adoption Barriers**
   - Teacher training requirements: 5–20 hours typical
   - Technical support needed
   - Initial setup and calibration time
   - Cost considerations (robot + maintenance + training)

## Identified Research Gaps

**Gaps Found (for future research)**:
1. Limited studies on long-term effects (>1 year of robot use)
2. Few studies comparing different humanoid robot models
3. Limited research on accessibility for specific disability types
4. Few studies on implementation costs and true ROI at school scale
5. Limited evidence on sustainability (robot maintenance, teacher retention, adoption persistence)
6. Minimal research on cross-cultural classroom contexts

## Validation Test Plan

### Test 1: Source Peer-Review Validation
- [x] Verify each source published in peer-reviewed venue
- [x] Document publication type (journal, conference)
- [x] Confirm no gray literature or vendor content

### Test 2: Claim-to-Source Tracing
- [ ] Map each claim in final document to 1+ source(s)
- [ ] Verify quote/paraphrase accuracy against original
- [ ] Ensure no unsupported assertions

### Test 3: Metric Accuracy
- [ ] Spot-check 50% of statistics against original sources
- [ ] Verify percentages, effect sizes, sample sizes quoted correctly
- [ ] Document any discrepancies

### Test 4: Scope Adherence
- [ ] Verify no vendor-specific product reviews
- [ ] Confirm focus is on humanoid robots (not alternatives)
- [ ] Ensure K-12 focus maintained

## Deliverables from Search Phase

✓ **selected-sources.md**: 12 sources with metadata and status  
✓ **APA-References.md**: Full APA-formatted reference list (12 sources)  
✓ **source-validation-log.md**: Validation checklist and quality assessment  
✓ **Literature-Search-Strategy.md**: This document (methodology transparency)  

## Next Phase: Application Development

Once sources are locked (Phase 1 complete):
1. Extract findings from each source by application domain
2. Create case study documents (tutoring, behavioral, accessibility, operational)
3. Write preliminary research notes (500–1000 words per application)
4. Map claims to sources for traceability
5. Identify metrics and ROI data
6. Prepare validation test cases
