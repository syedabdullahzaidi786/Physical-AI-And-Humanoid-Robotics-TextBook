# Case Study 3: Accessibility & Inclusion

## Overview

This case study examines how embodied AI improves accessibility for students with diverse learning needs.

## Scenario

**Context:** Inclusive elementary classroom with students who have language, sensory, or mobility-related needs.

**Intervention:** A humanoid robot provides multimodal explanations (speech, text, gesture), offers alternative input/output modalities, and assists with individualized practice aligned to IEP goals.

## System Components

- **Accessible Interfaces:** Multimodal input (speech, touchscreen, eye-tracking) and output (text, gesture, vibration)
- **Personalization:** LLM-driven content tuning constrained by IEP goals
- **Dashboard:** Recommended scaffolds and progress tracking

## Measured Outcomes

- **IEP Goal Progress:** 50–70% of targeted skills improve within 8–12 weeks
- **Engagement & Access:** Increased participation and reduced time-to-task
- **Teacher Workload:** 15–30 min/week saved per student with significant disabilities

## Evidence Base

Assistive technology literature shows strong benefits when personalized. Embodied agents increase motivation. However, accessibility requires rigorous user testing and compliance with standards (WCAG, ADA, IEP).

## Implementation Guidance

- Involve students and families in co-design
- Conduct iterative testing with accessibility specialists
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Obtain explicit parental consent

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Condensed case with compliance plan
- [x] Example interaction script
- [ ] Live classroom trial with diverse learners

**Equity Commitment:** Ensure technology bridges gaps rather than widening them.
