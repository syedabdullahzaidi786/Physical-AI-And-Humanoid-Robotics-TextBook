# Specification Quality Checklist: Integrated RAG Chatbot for Embedded Book Knowledge

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-16
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - The spec focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - All user stories address clear user needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - Language is accessible to business stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed - User scenarios, requirements, success criteria, and entities are all present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All markers were resolved with reasonable defaults
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each requirement is specific and measurable
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - All success criteria include specific metrics or percentages
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - Criteria focus on outcomes, not implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Each user story includes clear Given/When/Then scenarios
- [x] Edge cases are identified - Multiple potential edge cases are documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Clear inclusions and exclusions defined in feature description
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Technology stack and constraints clearly specified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Requirements are specific and testable
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - Core user journeys are addressed with P1, P2, P3 priorities
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - Success metrics are specific and achievable
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - Focus remains on user value rather than technical implementation

## Notes

- All checklist items have been validated and completed
- The specification is ready to proceed to the next phase
